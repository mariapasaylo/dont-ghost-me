# Don't Ghost Me

Browser extension that sends automated reminders and follow-up emails when companies fail to provide updates on your job application within a specified timeframe.

## Problem Statement

Job applicants often face a significant challenge in keeping track of their job applications and the status of their communication with potential employers. One prevalent issue is "ghosting," where companies do not respond to applicants after initial contact or even after interviews. This leaves applicants in a state of uncertainty, wondering whether to follow up or move on to other opportunities. The lack of a systematic approach to manage follow-ups and track ghosting experiences can result in missed opportunities and unnecessary anxiety for applicants.

## Key Challenges

1. **Tracking Follow-ups**: Applicants need an effective way to monitor the status of their applications and know when to follow up if they haven't heard back.
2. **Managing Multiple Applications**: With numerous applications in progress, it's difficult to remember which companies to follow up with and when.
3. **Lack of Communication**: Companies sometimes fail to communicate their decision, leaving applicants waiting indefinitely.
4. **Collecting Ghosting Data**: There is no centralized platform where applicants can share and access information about companies' communication practices, making it hard to identify which companies are more likely to ghost applicants.

## Project Solution

Our solution addresses these challenges by developing an automated system that helps job applicants manage their follow-up process efficiently and keep track of potential ghosting incidents. The key features of the solution include:

### Browser Extension Integration

- **Integration with Popular Trackers**: Our extension integrates with existing job application trackers such as [Teal](https://tealhq.com) and [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs), enhancing their capabilities by adding automated follow-up and reminder features. This integration allows for seamless synchronization of job application data and follow-up reminders across platforms.
  
- **Reminders for Application Stages**: The browser extension provides reminders for different stages of the application process, allowing users to stay organized and never miss a follow-up opportunity.
  
- **Automated Follow-Up Emails**: Users can set a specific period after which an automated follow-up email will be sent if there has been no response from the company. This feature is facilitated through the extension and supports customizable scheduling and messaging.
  - **Two Customizable Templates**:
    - **Initial Submission**: A template for following up after submitting an application.
    - **Interview Follow-Up**: A template for following up after an interview, ensuring applicants stay top of mind with recruiters.

### Ghosting Tracker and Notification System

- **Ghosting Timeline Tracker**: A timeline tracker that notifies users when it's time to follow up, reducing the need for manual tracking and ensuring timely follow-ups. this can be manually added by the user or email client integration.

- **Ghosting Statistics Website**: A platform that collects and displays data on companies' communication practices. This website allows applicants to share their experiences and view the likelihood of being ghosted by specific companies.
  - **Ghosting Score**: Users can report companies for ghosting or timely follow-ups, contributing to a ghosting score that aids others in identifying companies with poor or strong communication practices. (WE NEED TO SHOW HOW WE CALCULATE THE SCORE TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY)
    
### Enhanced Features and Future Considerations

- **Recruiter Version**: We are exploring the possibility of creating a version for recruiters that helps them manage their follow-ups more efficiently, fostering better communication with applicants.
  
- **Enhanced Data Sharing**: Future updates will focus on developing a more comprehensive platform that aggregates ghosting data and provides detailed insights into companies' communication trends, helping applicants make more informed decisions.
